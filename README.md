## Beats Music Google Chrome App

While at work I like to move my music to an app on my computer rather than using my phone. This is no problem if you use Rdio or Spotify who have native Mac apps of varying degrees of success, but there is no such app for Beats Music. They do have a web presence though, so after losing my Beats Music tab for the upteenth time, I threw together a quick Google Chrome Packaged App to tide me over until the official Mac app arrives (which you have to believe is in the works after the Apple acquisition...and [they pretty much confirmed this to me.](https://twitter.com/mikeflynn_/status/487703510947860480))

## Usage

I'm sure I can't get this in to the Google Chrome Web Store (I'll try anyway) but worse case you can simply download this directory and then take the beats-app.crx file from the /app directory and drag it on to your Google Chrome Extensions page: *chrome://extensions/*

Once installed, you can run the app via the Chrome App menu (and if you're on OS X, you can set the app to stay in your Dock like any other app).

## Limitations

This was a very quick solution so it's not super full featured. One issue is that you can't close the window and have the music continue to play, however minimizing does the trick. There's also no extras like notifications or any of the usual Chrome App trappings as that would require more integration with the Beats Music web application.
